<p> Fire-related accidents have, on average, killed 35 people every day in the five years between 2016 and 2020, according to a report by Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI), maintained by the National¬†Crime Records Bureau. In the event of a fire breakout, to rescue people and to put out the fire we are forced to use human resources which are not safe. With the advancement of technology especially in Robotics it is very much possible to replace humans with robots for fighting the fire. This would improve the efficiency of firefighters and would also prevent them from risking human lives. We are going to build a Fire Fighting Robot using Arduino, which will automatically sense the fire and start the water pump. In this project, we will build a simple robot using Arduino that could move towards the fire and pump out water around it to put down the fire. </p>

<h2> üìùObjectives </h2>
<p> The purpose of this project is to design, build, and test a robot capable of extinguishing building and basement fires and effectively replacing a firefighter in highly dangerous situations. This robot continuously monitors the environment and extinguishes it without delay. </p>

<h2> ü§ñ Hardware & Software Specification </h2>

- Arduino: A microcontroller board that acts as the brain, controlling all sensors and motors in the robot.
- Fire Sensor: Detects flames or high heat and sends a signal to the Arduino for firefighting action.
- Motor driver module (L293D): Allows the Arduino to control the direction and speed of DC motors.
- Servo Motor: Rotates precisely to aim the water nozzle toward the fire.
- A small can: Serves as a water tank for storing water.
- Mini DC Submersible Pump: Pumps water from the can.
- 2 Motors: Drive the robot‚Äôs wheels for movement.
- 2 Wheels: Enable the robot to move in different directions.
- Breadboard: A platform for making temporary, solder-free electrical connections between components.
- Connecting wires: Carry electrical signals and power between the Arduino, sensors, and motors.
- Arduino IDE: Software used to write, compile, and upload code to the Arduino board.

<h2> üöí Conclusion </h2>
<p> The design's principles make it possible to upgrade our robot into a more durable system that can put out real flames in residential or business environments. The creation of a completely autonomous robot is the fundamental prerequisite for this project. This means that after the user turns on the robot, it moves around, looks for the fire, and puts it out entirely on its own, without the user's help or input. This project depicts the design and construction of a fire-fighting robot that moves towards the fire and pumps out water to extinguish it. The system may be helpful in supporting fire fighters and containing an outbreak. It was created a system that could detect a fire and then extinguish it with a water pump. It was successful to conduct research on various components and their interfacing procedures. </p>
